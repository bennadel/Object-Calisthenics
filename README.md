# Object Calisthentics 

This is my attempt at executing the Object Calisthenics exercise in JavaScript 
as described by Jeff Bay in this PDF, originally from the ThoughtWorks Anthology
on Pragmatic Programmers:

## The 9 Rules of Object Calisthenics 

Object Calisthenics outlines 9 basic rules to apply when performing the exercise:

* One level of indentation per method.
* Don't use the ELSE keyword.
* Wrap all primitives and Strings in classes.
* First class collections.
* One dot per line.
* Don't abbreviate.
* Keep all classes less than 50 lines.
* No classes with more than two instance variables.
* No getters or setters.

More to come soon!

## Special Thanks

I wanted to give a special thanks to Brian Kotek who originally introduced me 
to this exercise:
